Problems:
-How to have the pdf crash?
-How to have the pdf print the flag?
-They can modify the latex however they want => Need them to send the opcode? Send them a pdf back? A secret back? Then make them compile it.... :-D
 Made easy to debug? 
Ideas:
- Have all letters encode constants, call eval each time?
- Have unique flags?
TODO:
- Have 
- Figure out exactly how to do the print 

       
       
- Some crypto

Have them find the POW
    => First part 
Send POW
Send back Bezier work
Flag

Underscore => turn technique



SECURITY make each group have a diffrent key (flag) and different encription
    => only print flag ig both are correct
    
number => not in key!

EVAL <=> FSM
OK have eval{char}, with a certain number of fixed then a certain number of chellenge ones

TODO for POC:
- Get array and transformation
- have the validate check multiples
- have a reset character
- after reset check if always smaller
- have group number
=> extract group number
=> char to int and vice versa
=> ARRAYS (maybe list of items)



 - get variables figured out
 - replace variables
 - get svg parser
 - do calculation
 - find/replace python
 - circle arcs 
SOCAT for server

Welcome
outstanding  
texnologies
numbers ???? => not in key, maybe fun np? or just 1
Have last letters be found using num 
t = 2
all occurences of letter identical

 mod 4 +1 7n+1 +3 7n-1
 
 have tons of rules, each letter/number 
 - np >/< then next
 - store/load values
 - multiple of other np
  
o => 0
l => 1
z => 2
e => 3
a => 4
s => 5
g => 6
t => 7
b => 8

Yeah I totally put in the work, definitely wasn't doing ctf FLAG LEN = 60

You've been working on a super hard report with a friend. He's finished the implementation, but asks to prove you're written the report first 
You're supposed to hand in the work you've done
